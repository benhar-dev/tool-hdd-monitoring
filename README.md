## Description

This repository demonstrates how to use Windows Performance Toolkit to see what processes are writing to the hard drive.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Admin privileges
- Windows Performance Toolkit

## Step 1: Install Windows Performance Toolkit

1. Download the **Windows ADK**:
   [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install)

2. During setup, select only the Windows Performance Toolkit

![WPT](./docs/images/install-wpt.png)

This installs:

- `WPR.exe` (recorder)
- `WPA.exe` (analyzer)

## Step 2: Start a Disk I/O Trace

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
2. Start the trace using:

   ```sh
   WPR -start diskio -filemode
   ```

   This will begin recording detailed disk write activity to disk.

## Step 3: Reproduce the Disk Activity

- Let your computer run normally, or perform the action that causes high disk usage.
- Record for a few minutes.

## Step 4: Stop and Save the Trace

When you're ready, stop the trace and save the results:

```sh
WPR -stop highdisk.etl
```

This creates a file named `highdisk.etl` that contains performance trace data.

## Step 5: Analyze the Trace with WPA

1. Launch **Windows Performance Analyzer**:

   ```sh
   wpa.exe
   ```

2. Open the `highdisk.etl` file.

3. In the left-hand Graph Explorer pane, add the following graph:

   - `Activity by IO Type, Process`

   ![WPT](./docs/images/add-graph.png)

4. Drill down by:

   - **Write**
   - **Process**

## Clean Up

You can delete `.etl` files after analysis. They may be large depending on trace duration.

## Uninstall

Windows Performance Analyzer can be uninstalled using the standard "Add remove programs" and uninstalling the "Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit" (may also be under Windows Performance Toolkit).
